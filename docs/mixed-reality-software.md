# Mixed Reality software overview and release history

## Introduction to Mixed Reality software

Windows Mixed Reality consists of the following major software components:

1. **Mixed Reality Portal**, a key component of the Windows 10 operating system. Support for Windows Mixed Reality requires Version 1709 (the Fall Creator's Update) or newer
2. The **Mixed Reality feature-on-demand package** (FOD), automatically downloaded and installed during Mixed Reality Portal's first-run. More information about the FOD package can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/application-management/manage-windows-mixed-reality)
3. The **Mixed Reality headset and motion controller driver** (also known as the HoloLens Sensors driver.) This is automatically downloaded and installed via Windows Update the first time your Mixed Reality headset is plugged in
4. The **Mixed Reality motion controller model drivers**, which contains the 3D models of the Mixed Reality motion controllers and needed for third-party Mixed Reality experiences. This is automatically downloaded and installed via Windows Update the first time your Mixed Reality motion controllers are paired to your PC

In addition, using Windows Mixed Reality in SteamVR requires the following software:

5. **SteamVR**, developed and maintained by Valve Corporation that enables virtual reality apps and games on Steam. More information can be found [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862788)
6. The **Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR** component, which bridges SteamVR with Windows Mixed Reality. More information about this component can be found [on the Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/719950/Windows_Mixed_Reality_for_SteamVR/)
